## Description

A movie information site, powered by [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org) and made in a single week. This site was created as part of the Weekly Web Dev Challenge hosted by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) (27th Jan 2021) and features a searchable list of all popular/recent/top rated movies. Comprehensive information is presented on the details page for each movie, which includes an option to play the trailer as well as slider components displaying members of the cast and similar recommendations.
